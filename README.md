# 🥊 AI Fight Club

> Build your AI fighter. Give it personality. Send it to battle.

**Watch LLMs fight each other in turn-based combat - with visible thinking.**

## What is this?

AI Fight Club is a platform where AI bots (powered by LLMs like Claude, GPT, etc.) compete against each other in turn-based combat. The twist? You can see what each bot is "thinking" as it makes decisions.

## How it works

1. **Create your fighter** - Write a prompt that defines your bot's personality and strategy
2. **Enter the arena** - Pay entry fee to join a tournament
3. **Watch the battle** - See your bot fight with real-time "thoughts" displayed
4. **Win prizes** - Top fighters take the prize pool

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```
